Activity since last data dump (4/6/2015) will be incorrect, as it contains only
review activity (from scraped profiles) but not other activity (from sede).

Each file is histogram in weekly bins, date range is earliest date of any activity
by any nominee to now; so all files have same date range.

Columns:

  total - total activity events
  accept,badge,comment,post,review,revision,suggest - equivalent to profile pgae tabs.
